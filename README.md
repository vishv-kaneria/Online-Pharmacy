# Online-Pharmacy
The evolution of digital healthcare services is reshaping how individuals access medical supplies. An Online Pharmacy Web Application represents a crucial step toward enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of pharmaceutical services. This project aims to develop a user-friendly, secure, and efficient platform that enables users to purchase medications online, and access pharmaceutical information, thus bridging the gap between patients and healthcare services.

In constructing our Online Pharmacy Web Application, we will implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for a streamlined and scalable architecture. Classes will be employed to modularize entities and functionalities, enhancing code organization. Inheritance ensures code reuse, while encapsulation maintains data integrity. Polymorphism provides adaptability, and abstraction guides consistent implementations. By adopting these OOP concepts, we aim to develop a robust, user-friendly online pharmacy platform, seamlessly connecting patients with pharmaceutical services and healthcare professionals.
